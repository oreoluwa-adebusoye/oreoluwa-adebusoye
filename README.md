# 💫 About Me:
## 👋🏾 Hey, I’m Oreoluwa<br><br>🎓 CS + Data Science student @ Loyola University Maryland <br>🧠 I'm super curious. Always asking “why though?” or “how does this work?” until I end up halfway through a YouTube tutorial or coding it myself.<br> 💻 Lately, I’ve been getting into data analysis, full-stack development, backend development, machine learning, and anything that blends logic + creativity.<br>🚀 I'm part of Break Through Tech’s AI Fellowship and loving the chaos of learning fast and building in public.<br>👀 Currently working on: personal projects, leveling up my technical confidence, and trying to make cool things without overthinking them.<br>👯‍♀️ Would love to collaborate on anything intentional — especially if it involves community, equity, data, or just something weird and fun.<br>💬 Ask me about: Break Through Tech, building while learning, or why I think spreadsheets are underrated.<br>🪄 Fun fact: I collect random knowledge like it’s Pokémon. Also, I lowkey enjoy writing README files like this.
